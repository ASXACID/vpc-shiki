# Contributing

It's helpful to note that this plugin uses [a fork of shiki](https://github.com/Vap0r1ze/shiki)

If you want to add a language, find a TextMate Grammar file for it (usually easily found in vscode extensions). You'll need to add an entry to [languages/index.js](./languages/index.js) as well

Feature requests are welcome too
